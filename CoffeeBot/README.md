# A useful and annoying bot using Discord.py and Kasa API
    Having already used the Discord.py API and lacking motivation to actually
    wake up on time, I've decided to use a Discord bot to facilitate an alarm.

### Goals
* Have bot trigger a message with Kasa
* Use event loops to handle checking state of Smart Plug
* Allow bot to constantly be running with Docker
