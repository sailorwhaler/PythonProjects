# Random D&D Character Generator

Use of the *Random module* in Python to create a new character for the TTRPG Dungeons & Dragons.  
    * Randomly rolls Ability Scores
        * Calculates modifiers based on the rolled ability scores.
        * Calulates Hit Points based on the Constitution modifier.
    * Returns a Race from the original Players Handbook.
    * Returns a Class from a list. 

## Things to consider:
* Adding more Races - The list has grown from the 9 included in the Players Handbook.
* List out modifier scores as a Dictionary - Key:Value pair instead of a list.
* Class use overall.
* Advantage/Disadvantage function?
* Sepearating out DiceRolling entirely?
